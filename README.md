**Old Threads, New Stories: The Future of Circular Fashion**

## Overview
ThreadRevive is a curated middle-man platform that connects thrifted clothing sellers with professional stylists and designers to upcycle garments for new owners. We aim to combat textile waste and the "Fast Fashion" crisis by extending the life cycle of clothing through a unique Value-Addition Layer.

Unlike standard thrift apps, ThreadRevive turns upcycling into a scalable service rather than a DIY project, ensuring every item is professionally redesigned before resale.

## Key Features
* **Value-Addition Layer:** Every item is professionally restored and styled by experts.
* **Designer Matching Engine:** A specialized module to match garments with the right stylist based on style and expertise.
* **AI-Powered Categorization:** Utilizes image recognition for automated clothing categorization.
* **3-Point Quality Check:** A digital verification system ensuring upcycled products meet high professional standards.
* **Upcycle Hubs:** Strategic regional hubs established to minimize shipping distances and reduce carbon footprints.
* **Sustainability Core:** Focuses on moving fashion from a linear "disposal" model to a circular "restoration" model.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js — For a high-performance, responsive marketplace UI.
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express — Handling secure user transactions and API logic.
* **Database:** MongoDB — Management of inventory and designer portfolios.

## Architecture & Methodology
1. **Module 1 (AI Recognition):** Categorizes incoming thrift items.
2. **Module 2 (Matching Engine):** Connects the item to a designer based on the restoration goal.
3. **Module 3 (Marketplace):** The final upcycled product is listed for eco-conscious buyers.

## Impact
* **Environmental:** Diverts clothing from landfills and reduces the water/carbon footprint of fashion production.
* **Economic:** Empowers local designers and students by providing a professional platform to monetize their skills.
* **Social:** Leverages the booming Gen-Z "Slow Fashion" trend.
